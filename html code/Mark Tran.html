       My dream job is to work at a game company that makes live service games, RPGs, FPS, and more. I'm a game enthusiast and gamer, and I dream of working with a game company to gain experience and potentially make my own game. Ever since I was a child, I was inspired by Super Mario Galaxy because of its story, maps, and mini-games. I was so into it that one day I wanted to become a game developer. As of right now, I'll be going to Langara for two years in computer science to see if I'm qualified to work as a fresh grad.
